# Digital Advertising Reinforcement Learning: Summary Report

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes the implementation and results of a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to digital advertising keyword selection. The model successfully optimizes ad spend allocation by learning to identify high-performing keywords based on return on ad spend (ROAS) and other key metrics.

## Key Findings

### Training Performance
- **Training Stability**: The combination of Experience Replay and Target Network significantly improved training stability compared to using Experience Replay alone or using neither technique.
- **Cash Management**: The agent learned effective budget allocation strategies, demonstrated by exponential growth in cash balance over time by prioritizing keywords with higher ROAS.

### Keyword Selection Strategy
- **Decision Boundaries**: The model established clear selection criteria based on ROAS and CTR thresholds, optimizing for profitability.
- **Investment Quadrants**: Keywords were effectively categorized into "Star Performers" (high ROAS, high spend) to maintain, and low-performing keywords to optimize or reduce investment.

### Data Characteristics
- **Feature Correlations**: Analysis revealed significant correlations between advertising metrics in the actual dataset:
  - Strong correlation (0.93) between paid_clicks and ad_conversions
  - High correlation (0.76) between organic_ctr and organic_clicks
  - Notable correlation (0.66) between competitiveness and paid_ctr
- **Keyword Clustering**: PCA analysis demonstrated that keywords naturally cluster by behavior and performance characteristics, with 97.8% of variance explained by the first principal component in one analysis.
- **Profit Distribution**: Keywords like "Urlaub buchen" (vacation booking) and "Mietwagen" (car rental) showed higher expected profit, while service-related keywords like "Online Shopping" and "Hotel buchen" had different performance profiles.

## Strategic Implications

1. **Optimization Framework**: The reinforcement learning approach provides a data-driven framework for continuous optimization of advertising spend across keywords.

2. **Automatic Decision Making**: The model can automate keyword selection decisions based on learned patterns, reducing manual intervention.

3. **ROI Maximization**: By prioritizing keywords with strong ROAS and carefully managing the allocation of the advertising budget (10% of available cash per step), the model demonstrates effective ROI maximization.

4. **Pattern Recognition**: The model successfully identifies and exploits meaningful patterns in keyword performance data, as evidenced by the stark contrast between the correlated real dataset and the uncorrelated random dataset.

## Recommendations

1. **Deploy for Continuous Learning**: Implement the model in a production environment where it can continue to learn and adapt to changing market conditions.

2. **Expand Feature Set**: Consider incorporating additional features such as seasonal trends, competitor activity, and market saturation to further enhance model performance.

3. **Segmentation Strategy**: Use the identified keyword clusters to develop targeted advertising strategies for different keyword groups.

4. **Performance Monitoring**: Regularly evaluate model performance against traditional manual optimization approaches to ensure continued effectiveness.

5. **Budget Allocation Refinement**: Fine-tune the budget allocation percentage (currently 10%) based on business risk tolerance and cash flow requirements.

## Technical Implementation

The implementation leverages TorchRL framework with:
- Custom environment (AdOptimizationEnv) simulating keyword selection and budget management
- Deep Q-Network architecture with experience replay and target network
- Exploration-exploitation balance through epsilon-greedy approach
- Systematic evaluation on separate test datasets

This reinforcement learning approach demonstrates significant potential for optimizing digital advertising strategies through automated, data-driven decision making.
